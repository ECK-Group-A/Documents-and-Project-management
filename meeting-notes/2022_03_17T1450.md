# Meeting 17 March 2022 14:50

## Present:

* Fernando Garcia Fernandez
* Bas van Driel
* Bart Louwes
* Bob Swinkels

## Content

* Mr. Garcia has gotten approval from the Hague University to buy/send the requested products. The Camera needs to be purchased new, since the university does only have ones with a USB-connection. If there is after 2 weeks no reaction from the university, Mr. Garcia will bring a camera from Spain at the end of the month.

* The GPS is a different story. It is implemented in the car and is at the moment not available.

* Yesterday, a test is done with a different microcontroller with 2 timers and a code.

* The project group wants to use a STM32 to get a smaller error of the signal.

* Mr. Garcia wants the PPS signal of the GPS seperated (in case the cable is lose or broken). The signal needs to be available if the signal of the GPS is gone.

* Mr. Garcia wants to use the system even in extreme circumstances (for the reason given above). That means the camera's should still be usable if no GPS.

* The information of the GPS goes 'to the LIDAR and the computer of Rpi'

* NTP and NMEA signals need to be in sync. It doesn't need to be perfect but it is prefered to get the signals as close as possible.

* Next meeting with Mr. Garcia - next week Thursday at 15:00
